_Home Assistant® custom integration for SDVoE API™ control._

**⚠️ This integration is currently under active development.**

---

## 📖 About

**RiverLink SDVoE Matrix** is a Home Assistant® custom integration that enables control of **SDVoE™ (Software Defined Video over Ethernet)** matrix systems via the SDVoE API™. This integration allows you to manage video routing, audio routing, and display modes directly from your Home Assistant® dashboard.

### 🔌 Requirements

- **Home Assistant®** 2025.2.4 or newer
- **BlueRiver® AVP system** with network-accessible API endpoint
- **Network access** to the BlueRiver® control process (default port: 6970)
- **SDVoE API™** version 2.13.0.0 or compatible

**Developer:** [switch180](https://github.com/switch180)

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- ✅ **Device Discovery** - Automatic detection of receivers and transmitters
- ✅ **Video Routing** - Dynamic source-to-display mapping via HDMI streams
- ✅ **Audio Routing** - HDMI embedded audio follows video routing
- ✅ **Temperature Monitoring** - Real-time device temperature sensors
- ✅ **Connection Status** - Online/offline state for all devices
- ✅ **Stream State Tracking** - Monitor active/inactive video streams

### 🖥️ Display Control
- ✅ **Display Modes** - Full support for all 5 modes:

  - **Fast Switch** (multi-source switching, aspect-preserved)
  - **Fast Switch Stretch** (multi-source, stretch to fill)
  - **Fast Switch Crop** (multi-source, crop to fit)
- ✅ **Resolution Presets** - 26 named presets (broadcast + computer formats)
- ✅ **Custom Resolutions** - Support for non-standard resolutions via genlock mode
- ✅ **Signal Information** - Resolution, color space, HDCP status, bit depth

### 📊 Entity Types Created
- **Per Receiver** (9 entities):
  - 6 Sensors: Temperature, Video Source, Audio Source, Video Signal, IP Address, Firmware
  - 3 Binary Sensors: Online, Video Streaming, Audio Streaming  
  - 3 Selects: Video Source, Display Mode, Resolution Preset
  
- **Per Transmitter** (7 entities):
  - 6 Sensors: Temperature, HDMI Stream, Audio Stream, Input Signal, IP Address, Firmware
  - 1 Binary Sensor: Online

### 🚧 Not Yet Implemented
